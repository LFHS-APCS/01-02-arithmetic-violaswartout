Java Arithmetic

Goal: To see how basic arithmetic operations behave.

1. Open the 01.02.Arithmetic assignment

2. Run the program and choose to test doubles.  Enter decimal (doubles) when requested.  

3. What does the “/” operation do with doubles? 


4. Choose to test integers now.  Enter integers when requested. 


5.  What does the operation "/" do now?  


6. What do you think "%" is doing? (Try running the program several times with different input.  Hint:  It is related to "/".) 



7. In Temperature.java, write the method ```convertTemperature```.  Instructions are in that file.
